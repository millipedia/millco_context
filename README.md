# Save As From Context Menu

Simple VSCode extension to add *Save* and *Save As* commands to the editor context menu (can't believe this isn't there by default)

Mostly the code was lifted wholesale from 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66841395/add-a-save-item-to-vscode-editor-context-menu

and then tweaked to include Save As.

To install you just clone / save this into a folder ''millco_context'' in your VSCode extensions directory (usually /users/home/[username]/.vscode/extensions )
